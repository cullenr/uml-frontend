#HTML UML Editor

##Overview

This is an attempt at making an html based UML editor. I could not find a good accessible way of writing Class and Activity diagrams on different platforms and so I decided to write my own editor.

##Goals

1. Ability to create Class Diagrams.
1. Ability to create Activity Diagrams.
1. Ability to save diagrams to svg.
1. Snap grid.
1. Marquee Selection.
1. Add tools to scale diagram for printing.
1. Add a backend so that users can sign up and save diagrams, they should then be able to reference them from README files for example.
1. Add more goals and diagrams as project progresses.

##Limitations

This software is not designed to run on IE, if it does thats just good fortunate.
